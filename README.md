This is the backend of Speaking Geo-GP assistant.

### Following is our tech-stack:

* **Raw Dataset** which includes satellite imagery, metadata and some demographic data provided by `ISRO` and `Census of 2011`.

* **MongoDB** as database since it provides flexible query mechanism for geospatial data.

* **NodeJS** for backend, making it asynchronous, scalable, and agile.
  We use `ExpressJS` to implement a web API which communicates with the Android application.

* **NLP library** for analyzing command and intent from text.

* **Translation library** for translating between regional languages.
